<p>This next section is <strong>part of my 2nd course </strong><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap/?referralCode=DF0142C1957FA18DE7EE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>The Complete Junior to Senior Developer Roadmap</strong></a>&nbsp;where I give you a step by step tutorial on how to get out&nbsp;of being a Junior Developer and towards&nbsp;becoming&nbsp;a Senior Developer. Redux is an advanced topic but also important in this day and age especially if you are looking to work as a React Developer, so I have decided to add it to this course.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>HOWEVER:&nbsp;</strong>I recommend that you skip this part, finish the course, and then return to these videos at the end.&nbsp;We cover some difficult topics that you would learn more from if you have the foundation from the rest of the sections. Remember, this course was designed without this section in mind, so think of this as a little bonus for your brain.&nbsp;<br><br>With that said, Redux is one of my favourite libraries because it teaches you really really good programming concepts. Enjoy, and get ready to have your mind blown! :</p>
